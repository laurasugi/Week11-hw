                <p>Located just outside San Francisco, Muir woods is located in Marin County, California.  The 554 acre park includes Mt. Tamalpias and one of the only remaining old-growth redwood forrests in the area.
                You may recognize the woods as the setting for <i>Rise of the Planet of the Apes</i>, however that movie was actually filmed in British Colombia.  </p>

                <p> 
                Redwood national park in Humbolt county is an incredibly beautiful and surreal old growth rainforest.  There are hikes ranging from easy strolls to weeklong backpacking trips.  There is also a huge range of terrain, with the park including coastlands, mountains and rivers.  The Smith and Klamath rivers both run through the park, and the park also includes large prarie areas. 
              	Perhaps one of my favorite things about the park is that the Tall Tree grove was used for shooting most of the Endor scenes in <i>Star Wars: The Return of the Jedi</i>!
