#### Week 11-Parallax
I really enjoyed this week's subject! I've seen many parallax sites while surfing the web and have always really liked the design.  I think that this week was the first time that I have made a site that I am pleased with visually and that has definitely inspired me and has excited me about learning more.  
It was also relieving that the reading material was shorter this week so that I could spend more time on the coding.

#### Issues
This week went pretty smoothly, other than two minor issues.
  +I couldn't figure out how to move the `<span>` elements around to repotition the text. This was a minor issue, I just wanted to move the text so that it looked better with the image.
  +I also couldnt figure out how to decrease the opacity on individual elementssuch as the text boxes instead of on the entire page. Again, a minor detail but something I cjust couldn't seem to figure out.
